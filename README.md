- Takes user input as a query.

The script fulfills the requirements of Task 3 (Practical Implementation) by demonstrating API usage, logical code structure, and basic content moderation.

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Libraries:
  - `google-generativeai` (for Google Gemini API)
  - `python-dotenv` (for loading API key from `.env`)
